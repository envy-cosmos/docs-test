# Updates
## NFT Projects 
### Trooprs/Devotio
* waiting for Passage to finalize contracts, will be ready for next week
	* creation of multisig: waiting for them to send an address, then asking dimi to create multisig wallet
* secondary market royalties all go to Ren regardless of whether it was from public sale or airdrop (all the same set) - only revenue for NETA DAO and Passage is the initial sale

### Others
* haven't started conversation with Passage re: metaverse stuff - don't want to overhype something and begin working on it before we're ready
* [@Tardigrades_NFT](https://twitter.com/Tardigrades_NFT) followed Ren's Troopr progression and they're interested in working with NETA for something similar (ex, 2500 NFTs - most sold, some drop to active members)

## Outreach
* Jake on Core-1 close to DAODAO team
* working on DAO testing this coming week, then around April 14, set up the DAO and officially send funds
* Galactic Punks - connected but member is busy, will reach out to us - if we don't receive word, GlowGator will contact and start conversation
	* validator - drafting server architecture and assessing requirements
		* if able to compare notes with Galactic Punks, we see what they used in terms of structure and modify it from LUNA to fit JUNO validator requirements
* [@IBCFrens](https://twitter.com/IBCFrens) considering a validator, also worth reaching out

# DAO Structure Discussion
- GlowGator's model
	- time-saving mechanisms/reducing cognitive load valuable to Cosmos ecosystem
- "Can there be one NETA DAO or many?
	- a DAO is legitimized when it both acquires funding and performs governance - coming actions will establish it 
	- we'll have the funds sent after Troopr sale and can start performing governance - we can't have a fair decision on how/what to build without voting
	- start establishing parameters (threshold, quorum, minimum deposits) when making contact with DAODAO
	- other DAOs established some of these parameters (ex, ARTO DAO)
		- Passing threshold: 60%
		- Proposal deposit refund: OFF
		- 60 ARTO proposal deposit (Max Supply of token: 18k)

# "Off-Script" Ideas
- "community accelerator" - NETA providing tools and consulting to strengthen and legitimize community
- long-term value capture - Cosmos at its base level is very much function over form. ATOM price action isn't flashy but its value is found in technical and community development
- "do something good, do something meaningful, take your time, do it right, and the money will follow"

# Priorities for following week
**Speak With:**
- *DAODAO*: Jake on Core-1 well-connected with DAODAO team, can reach him/them through dimi
- *Tardigrades*: collaboration with NFTs [@Tardigrades_NFT](https://twitter.com/Tardigrades_NFT)

**Do:**
- DAO testing throughout the week, reconvene next DAO call with results and plan for formal establishment the week after
- schedule a time with Maxjuno to sit down and adjust Discord server permissions (permission-restricted channels) and create workgroups, particularly for NFTs and DAO testing
