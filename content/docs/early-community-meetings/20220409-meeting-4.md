# Updates
- JUNO chain halt - self-explanatory. DAO testing on hold most of the week
- waiting on IBC to stabilize, tentative NETA Troopr mint Monday 4/11, Passage team makes the call
- contact made with Galactic DAO, validator questions written for them, input available before GlowGator sends off
- TrickyCrypto (affiliated with [@Cosmos_Spaces](https://twitter.com/Cosmos_Spaces)) offering validator info in \#dao-general

# DAO Testing + Development
- DAO created for testing purposes, fake NETA tokens using Junomint tool, created DAO. will share links on \#daodao-tooling-and-testing 
- creating set of instructions for people to test next week (proposals, testing with various configurations of quorum, threshold, proposal deposit)
- problem: when you create tokens on Junomint, it delivers to creator's primary wallet - will need to manually deliver to testnet participants
- started with default settings, can change parameters once a DAO is created with a proposal
- creating list of things to do to test DAO, one item being changing parameters
- testnet participants are recommended to create new wallet in Keplr for test tokens to avoid revealing their holdings
- DAO Constitution - not really possible to do anything in terms of "voter/holder rights" in a legal sense (formal definition of constitution) but mission statement/general purpose can, should, and will be written
	- commonwealth topic to be made for this

# Priorities for following week
**Speak With:**
- *DAODAO*: Jake on Core-1 well-connected with DAODAO team, can reach him/them through dimi
- *Tardigrades*: collaboration with NFTs (@Tardigrades_NFT)
- *Galactic DAO, TrickyCrypto*: validator questions and brainstorming

**Do:**
- DAO testing throughout the week, reconvene next DAO call with results and plan for formal establishment the week after
- schedule a time with Maxjuno to sit down and adjust Discord server permissions (permission-restricted channels) and create workgroups, particularly for NFTs and DAO testing
- begin migrating activity to [commonwealth.im/neta-money](https://commonwealth.im/neta-money) for formal discussion
