#### Update your Chrome-based browsers (ex, Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera)! An emergency security update has been pushed today - missing the update could compromise your Extensions (read: Keplr and your wallet).

### 1) Progress reports from previous week 
#### Value Capture for Treasury:
**Devotio NFTs:**
- Cryptocito had an NFT giveaway, Passage has been promoting Troopers
- able to tweet about Neta Troopers on [@NetaMoney](https://twitter.com/NetaMoney) using Dimi as messenger
- need to create guide for steps to buy NETA Troopers since they need to IBC transfer ATOM
- Passage team to get address for multisig wallet, Dimi/Ren/Heisenberg creating signature for NFT sale fund wallet and relay to DAO once sale is complete 
- Passage waiting for public mint to be sold out before distribution of Devotio NFTs - this is the first minting they're implementing with smart contracts

**Other NFT projects:**
- Strange Clan integration: world building tools coming out soon?
- once NETA branding solidifies, start building items for Passage (ex, Roman architecture) whether implemented in Strange Clan or other worlds
	- team of artists building creates new revenue stream for DAO

**Validator feasibility research/planning:**
- Dimi previously confirmed running a multisig validator is possible
- unsure if Tendermint Core would need to run as base prerequisite or only Juno, can consult with other validators
- Tendermint Core: https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/validators.html
- Juno: https://docs.junonetwork.io/validators/joining-mainnet#recommended-minimum-hardwaretendermint
- would need testnet validator setup as well
- often run through AWS EBS; 3-5 sentry nodes "running interference" for main validator server; can be installed in other regions (ex, western/eastern hemispheres)

**Branding, social media and Twitter:**
- inheriting @NetaMoney under DAO ownership or making a new account?
	- per Dimi, better for the Twitter account to be managed by a DAO, Core-1 will need to make an official decision re: handoff
	- can still use @NetaMoney for NETA Troopers announcements in the meantime, send postings to Dimi
- visual branding ideas, images in front of us - color palette, themes, iconography
- website usage - FAQ, lore, branding, content - contact Core-1 for handoff decision on this as well
- NETA ambassador program? community volunteers
	- Secret does a similar thing (https://scrt.network/committees), Shade had Spartan Program

**NETA DAO Updates/Setup/Tokenomics:**
- working on tokenomics and procedural setup
- [Galactic Punks DAO](https://twitter.com/thegalacticdao) on Terra - similar roadmap, community validator model, NFTs linking everyone together, NFT staking
- possible to integrate existing tokens to DAO treasury as reward? ex, give JUNO reward for staking NETA in the DAO?

### 2) New ideas/concepts
- noticed the biggest NETA whale is using staking rewards from other coins to buy NETA
- Cosmos SDK v0.44 has [Authz](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.44/modules/authz/), implemented in [REStake](https://restake.app/) for auto-recompounding
- possible use case: utilizing Authz to allow automatic claiming and swapping rewards for NETA over a DEX - automatic "store of value"
	- if we create a validator, this can be set by default - allow delegators to select a percentage of rewards to be automatically "rolled off" into NETA
		- small transaction fee of NETA routed to DAO treasury?
- adjacent to Secret Network - can we work with wrapped coins for a private store of value?
	- create sNETA for their DEXes - can CW-20 tokens be wrapped or only sovereign chains?
		- believed to be coming to Secret's functionality in a few months

### 3) Build consensus on priorities for following weeks
**Speak With:**
- *Core-1*: handoffs of social accounts and website (use established ones or make new ones? how to handle decentralized website management?)
- *DAODAO*: hash out goals and what we want to achieve - tokenomics, governance, general purpose (Jake on Core-1 and twilight as good points of contact)
- *Galactic Punks DAO*: information sharing, brainstorming re: similar roadmap
- *Passage*: clarification on world building tool availability

**Do:**
- write instructions for ATOM IBC transfer to buy Troopers NFTs (@NetaMoney to retweet these, contact Dimi when complete)
- reorganize Discord server and set up workgroup areas for dedicated teams (work with Max for redesign)
