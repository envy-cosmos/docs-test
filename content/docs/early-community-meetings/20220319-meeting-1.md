### 2) Overview of work to date on DAO
- several ideas were discussed in previous weeks (autocompounding, staking rewards, DEXes) but no concrete work yet
- **March 31**: NETA NFTs launching on [Passage Marketplace](https://market.passage3d.com/), tentative price of 6 ATOM
- 80% to DAO, 10% to Rendrasc, 10% to Passage team
	- will generate about 12k ATOM, 9.6k ATOM in coffers to start with

- got in touch with dimi, ITA Stakers willing to help as well
	- dimi able to help on dev/programming/smart contract side

### 3) Identify immediate challenges
- NETA token distribution came before the DAO, now all tokens are outside the DAO, so there's no centralized community pool, no inflation on token so no incentive to stake
- compared to ION: facing a lot of the same challenges, but they have 75% of the tokens in the DAO (centralized fund)

### 4) Identify immediate priorities
##### How do we generate a treasury? How can we incentivize deposits of NETA into the DAO? How do we accumulate assets to incentivize?
Possible solutions:
- users that deposit get voting power to guide the direction of the DAO
- vesting schedule of deposited NETA where some amount is returned to users over time
- community-run JUNO validator where profits are forwarded to treasury
	- dimi has confirmed that a validator can be run with multisig
	- minimum mainnet hardware requirements: https://docs.junonetwork.io/validators/joining-mainnet#recommended-minimum-hardware
- borrowing/lending against NETA
	- six week old token, too early for people to have confidence in price range
	- Terra started buying BTC for reserves; [Nomic BTC bridge to Cosmos coming in Q2 2022](https://blog.nomic.io/nomic-stakenet-launch)
- secondary token airdrop for NETA holders where a percentage is dropped into DAO treasury (discussed 50%)
	- drawback: now need to create value for two tokens
- NFT projects, create and sell NFT series where royalties or profits go into treasury
	- play off Stargaze launch in current ecosystem
	- seek out artists to commission content; NETA community artists making NFTs for [Strange Clan](https://strangeclan.com/)
- create NETA content for existing NFT platforms and games
	- NETA guild in Strange Clan
- coupon or unlocking feature for holding certain NFTs
	- commission the artist for Osmosis, holders would get a gas fee discount. would need to collaborate with core devs and DEX operators for code implementation
- review new CW-20 tokens or give proposal feedback on commonwealth, offer due diligence service for JUNO community
	- "stamp of approval" to maintain integrity in JUNO community
	- NETA was dropped to JUNO's most active stakers - people in the NETA community are invested in JUNO's success
	- creates set of governance standards
	- potential risk: creates pressure around NETA brand

### 5) Review NETA purpose/prior agreements/consensus
- "store of value" agreed upon as brand statement - no reason to change original view
- shotgun approach to creating media for both branding and capturing value for treasury
- capitalize on Roman mythology iconography for art - goddess [Juno Moneta](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Juno-Roman-goddess)
- measure twice, cut once - take a little more time to do it right, work with what we have, no need to overcomplicate
