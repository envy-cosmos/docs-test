Neta DAO Docs serves as a document hub for DAO participants as well as prospective members or unaffiliated observers, primarily housing notes and technical documentation. Particular elements of the latter will be permission-restricted in the interest of operational security (read: not giving bad actors clues on where/how to attack).
